    <p>To my baby, my sweetheart, my honeybunch sugarplum, my cupcake sa ibabaw ng icing ko, my motivation, my reason, my everything—Happy Birthday!!</p>
    <p>Years have already passed, but the feelings I’ve felt for you are still the same. I still like you for your humorous jokes and your kind soul. I still like you for the way you are. You truly deserve to be loved—that’s why I am trying to make you feel it.</p>
    <p>I don’t know if I truly deserve to have you—to be loved by you. After everything, how could you still love and forgive me? I am afraid that I wouldn’t be able to give you the love you truly deserve. I’m afraid that you’ll meet someone who can give you everything without struggling. But I don’t have a choice, though. If I am not worthy enough—if even with simple words I cannot express myself, and I struggle—it is not your fault, it’s mine. And I will never blame you for it. I would still love you, even if you won’t choose me.</p>
    <p>You’ve built a home in my heart, where laughter echoes through the expanding and contracting chambers—creating a rhythmic pulse of joy.</p>
    <p>Thank you for being patient with me, especially on the days when I bottle everything up and say nothing. I want to stay through the storms, through the highs and lows, and through this chaotic world. You truly deserve a love that’s constant and unwavering.</p>
    <p>I have never felt this warmth before. Your laughter, your beauty—everything about you—makes it feel so unreal.</p>
    <p>I am so truly thankful to have you in my life. May this gift I’ve made for you make your day, even though I am far away. May your life be filled with joy and laughter.</p>
